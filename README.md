# Project 6: Ruby on Rails Project

The goal of this project was to build a web application using Ruby on Rails that simplifies the CSE grader selection process. Currently, the process is somewhat confusing and unclear, as it is not done through a formal application, but by vague and somewhat random email correspondance. With the implementation of a website that allows students to submit applications and professors to view them, would create a more clear and direct way of hiring qualified candidates.
